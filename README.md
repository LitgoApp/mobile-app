# LitGo Android App
This repository is the Android app for Litgo.

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have Android Studio installed. You can then open the app by navigating to File->Open... and then selecting the directory you cloned this repo to.

If you have an AMD CPU, you may run into an error with trying to run an Android device in Android Studio. Try turning on CPU virtualization in the BIOS to fix this.

# Branches
Both the `main` and `prod` branches are protected from direct pushes, instead make your own branch from an up-to-date version of `main`, and then submit a pull-request from your feature branch to main.
